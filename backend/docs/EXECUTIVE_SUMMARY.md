## 🎮 Game Flow

### Complete Multiplayer Experience

```
1. Teacher Creates Game
   └─→ POST /api/trivia/session
   └─→ Receives join code (e.g., "ABC123")

2. Teacher Joins as Host
   └─→ socket.emit('host_session')
   └─→ Sees waiting lobby with join code

3. Students Join
   └─→ socket.emit('join_session', { joinCode })
   └─→ Enter waiting lobby
   └─→ Host sees players joining in real-time

4. Teacher Starts Game
   └─→ socket.emit('start_game')
   └─→ All players receive 'game_started' event

5. Questions Broadcast
   └─→ Server sends 'new_question' to all players
   └─→ Timer starts (server-side)
   └─→ Players submit answers

6. Live Scoring
   └─→ Server validates answers
   └─→ Calculates points (base + speed bonus)
   └─→ Broadcasts 'leaderboard_update' to all

7. Auto-Progression
   └─→ After time limit, next question sent
   └─→ Repeat until all questions completed

8. Game Ends
   └─→ Server sends 'game_over' event
   └─→ Final results displayed
   └─→ Results saved to MongoDB
   └─→ User stats updated
```
