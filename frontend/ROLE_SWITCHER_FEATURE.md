## 🎨 **UI Design**

### Role Switcher Card:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ● Currently viewing as: Student                        │
│   Access games, learning modules, and track progress   │
│                                    [Switch to Teacher] │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Visual Elements:
- **Status Dot:** Blue (student) or Green (teacher)
- **Current Role:** Bold text showing active role
- **Description:** Explains what each role can do
- **Button:** Green with arrow icon and loading spinner
- **Card:** White with glassmorphism effect

---

## ⚙️ **How It Works**

### 1. **Role Detection:**
- Reads current role from `userProfile.role`
- Shows appropriate UI based on current role

### 2. **Role Switching:**
- Toggles between 'student' and 'teacher'
- Resets role-specific fields:
  - `grade` (cleared when switching to teacher)
  - `subject` (cleared when switching to student)
- Updates localStorage immediately
- Triggers re-render of dashboard

### 3. **State Management:**
- Uses `setUserProfile` from UserContext
- Updates both local state and localStorage
- Smooth transition with loading state
