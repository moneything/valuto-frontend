## 🎯 User Experience Benefits

1. **Clearer Call-to-Action**: Single "Launch App" button is more intuitive
2. **Seamless Authentication**: Users don't see login/signup until they try to access the app
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Only ask for authentication when needed
4. **Better Onboarding**: Ensures all users complete profile before accessing features
5. **Professional Flow**: More like modern SaaS applications

## 📝 Notes

- The "Launch App" button uses Next.js `<a>` tag for proper navigation
- Clerk handles all authentication securely
- User profile data stored in localStorage (will move to backend later)
- Dashboard checks onboarding status on every load
- Loading states prevent flash of wrong content

---

## 🚨 Important

Make sure Clerk API keys are still in `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
```

Without these keys, the authentication flow won't work!

**Everything is ready to test! Open http://localhost:3000 and click "Launch App" to experience the new flow! 🎉**
