# About Valuto


Valuto is a new way to teach money skills to young people aged 11–18.

We are a team of entrepreneurs under 20, building the kind of financial education we wish we had at school.



Our mission is simple: help every student feel confident with money before they leave education so they can budget, save, invest and make smart choices for life.

Why It Is Needed Now


Young people in the UK are stepping into adulthood during a cost of living crisis, record housing costs and rising debt. Yet less than 40% feel prepared to manage money.



Most teenagers are never taught about credit scores, interest rates, borrowing or budgeting. This leaves them at risk of:

Taking out expensive credit or payday loans

Falling into unnecessary debt before their first job

Struggling with rent, bills and living costs at university

Missing opportunities to save and invest early



Valuto changes this by teaching real world money skills at the right time so students can make informed decisions and avoid costly mistakes.

What Makes Valuto Different


There is nothing else like Valuto in the UK.



Other programmes are static booklets or quick assemblies.

We deliver live, interactive full day workshops plus a year round gamified platform that keeps students learning long after the session.

Our team is close in age to the students, so we talk about real topics they care about such as side hustles, first jobs, credit, renting and investing early.

We invest a minimum of £500 in prizes for every year group during a single six hour workshop day. That level of immediate reward and engagement has never been seen before in UK financial education.

What We Do

Our Promise


Valuto helps every student go from “no idea about money” to “I know how to handle my first pay cheque, avoid debt and start building for my future.”



It is the UK’s first youth led financial education solution that combines live energy, gamified learning and a minimum £500 prize investment in just one school day.



Created by people who actually remember what it is like to be 16 and unsure about money, Valuto gives students the confidence to:

Avoid high interest borrowing and unnecessary debt

Budget and manage bills from day one

Build a healthy credit profile early

Save and invest with confidence

Take control of their financial future
